# Travis encrypted files

This directory contains a public/private keypair generated just for this repository.

The public key is a deploy key which has been added to the GitHub repo for push access.

The private key is encrypted using `travis encrypt-file` and then committed to this repo.

The decrypt commands are in `.travis.yml`.
